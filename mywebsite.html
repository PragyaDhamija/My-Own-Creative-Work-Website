            <h2 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME ðŸ˜Š</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Pragya. As rightly said by Albert Einstein, "Creativity is intelligence having fun." And I love being creative and making new things. It is fun to form and reform things with art.</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center"><em>I love crafting and painting</em></h3>
            <p>Hobbies I enjoy are doing math, playing card games, writing poems, but my favorite thing to do is crafting and painting. You can have fun by thinking of what to make while you are making it. I really enjoy crafting because it is very fun, and I feel satisfied when I am finished. It feels great to see what I have accomplished and what I like about it. I make things that I can be proud of. I do different types of things like making cards on birthday of people I love and making paintings. Once, I also tried painting my phone cover but it didn't turn out the way I expected it but still enjoyed doing it...</p>
